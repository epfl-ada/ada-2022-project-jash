Idiap: 

- one day of work/week
- a presentation at the end in front of ~15 people of the lab
- a report is asked of me
- at the start: reading and looking for :
gather what has been done maybe, a review of what has been done on the project?
visual feedback is not being considered 
now i must define what I want to do

- theyre not using machine learning in the current setup, theyre working on the joint angle trajectories atm.
- the camera that theyre using: oak-d it has an API with openCV

- TODO for next week:
going from project description, choose what you would like to do and maybe ill end up doing my own research on the part of the project and what I like
- in the caricature generation itself, maybe check and play around with CariGan public code base

they used google media pipe to detect facial features. they want to move them and apply transformation on them to move the face parts. so i should probably familiarize myself with mediapipe.
^ currently theyre using dlib! to detect the face and find the nose in the middle
- the report will end up being a standard technical review
  - literature review (what i do now)
  - describe the methods i use implement
  - do experiements, describe them
  - draw some conclusions

Learning of non-photorealistic renderings for a caricaturist robot 

This project aims to review, categorize and test existing approaches in deep learning to map an image to a set of trajectories that a robot can then draw on a canvas, by taking the example of portrait caricatures as an example of generative non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) problem (see CariGAN or WarpGAN as starting examples). Several data processing pipelines can be considered, with parts that can be specified manually, and others that can be learned from examples. It also includes the potential consideration of intermediary steps, such as detecting the location of facial features (e.g., by using Google's MediaPipe Face Mesh), image-to-image processing applying pencil/brush sketch rendering effects, or applying a distortion mask for a warping transformation defined explicitly. The project also aims at studying metrics or methods to compare these different approaches. The selected approach(es) will take into account the amount of data that these methods require, the availability of these data and of pretrained models, and the possibility of employing the selected method(s) on smartphones or CPUs (instead of GPUs).

The most fun I had working on a project was when I coded a medium sized project over an entire school semester with a teammate:
We basically coded the Swiss version of the "Ticket to Ride" board game, where we used Java alongside JavaFX for the GUI. The way it worked was that both players needed to have access to the game's jar file, with one player hosting the game server and the other one communicating with said server using a specific serializer/deserializer protocol we implemented. Since we did not set up a dedicated server online, we used the tool ngrok to make our own temporary tunnels over the web to play together. 
While my example here mentions 2 players, we extended the game to a total of 3 players (only 3 since any more than that would have removed the pleasure of playing since resources are limited)

get a chance to learn more Bloomberg tech. bloomberg built terminal before Linux exists. Bloomberg tech can be an exciting place for me to work.
2. The first motivation is Bloomberg training and enough freedom to select your own team to work for.
3. Until now I never got a chance to work on finance-related software. I think so Bloomberg terminal can be an exciting thing for me to work on because I like to deal with huge data, scaling issues and low-level stuff.
3. Opensource culture, publish blogs etc.
4. company culture, freedom, smart people etc.

mckinsey feedback - talk with Antigona Sadiku:
- nothing wrong on my cv
- reason i didnt get invited : they had too many people applying but very limited positions
- since im still doing my bachelors, I could further develop
- digital roles: computer science background, some coding but not quantum black level, alot of client interaction etc

visa issues: for mckinsey switzerland shouldnt be a big issue, but it limits a bit where I can work though there is the work permit visa -> not impossible 
grade wise: ofc they look at grades, but profile overall is quite improtant


what do you advise I do: apply in january 2023 for a position in september (6 months prior to staring date) -> full time position in masters since I'm at the end of my studies (they don't do Master projects!!)
they also have some spring internships!!!
recommended to do something in the meantime 
usually do case studies for the interview! thats about it, for personal part, usually a couple of stories/problems where I had to face leadership, personal impact 
mckinsey game: no feedback about this, my score was actually really good she tells me

good points:
impressed by the fact that this is the first image processing I do, i discovered a lot of things in short time, i did very well in learning new topics
I was autonomous, very good, semester project is not like an exercise, theres an aspect to see what could be the next step, when you see results question what is to come next

the point to improve:
mostly on the report for calinon, the english I need to use should be more formal, "simple phrases", "Be precise", 
dont use stuff like : no stackexchange reference, mathematical notation ( a B instead of using an x) , "the rbf kernels selected are very complex" -> no further explanation, 
in chapter 3; instead of using pipeline maybe something more scientific
for english language: "we run into an issue right off the bat", "as intended", "that's pretty cool" (xD) 

for bibliography; need to show where it appeared (journal/article/etc) -> maybe due to my .bibtex file
need to verify if my arxiv.org papers were published anywhere (anything on arxiv isnt peer-reviewed holy shit)

for the state-of-the-art: try to give a broad view, here I gave the impression that I picked out a few arts to show which makes it hard to have a general view
Tobi's points:
he agrees with sylvain's comments
regarding my presentation: it was good! independence was a strong point

want to go to Google? do Leetcode hard
any other place -> leetcode medium
then prepare for behavioral; he had his story at bloomberg, he failed at HR (damn)

he worked like 3 weeks on leetcode, he did anywhere from 4 to 12 problems 

very much worth paying for Leetcode premium

try a problem for 30min/1hr (no solution according to him)

getting stuck on a problem; make a list on all of the techniques that you've seen and go through the list and try to apply each of them

at fb, as a swe you can choose android/ios/web/backend; he went for backend. theres also ML btw, only open for people hired as ML engineers (if you're PhD or have previous experience) 
web: you do full stack basically
backend  (~systems): prolly most appealing if you come from EPFL, you build the core infrastructure of the company. you can work on databases/servers (many of them work on data pipelines, might be weird as SWE). you work on automation to save time for other engineers
so u can focus on product infrastructure (have web engineers)
or on core infra -> platform where ML is done etc

they use hack (php), c++, java, python and SQL
no one checks the time u work, work hours not strict but there is a lot of work
there's oncall too
if you like ML and want to use models , can be done in both CompSci and DataSci

want to work at FAANG? can be SWE, ML engineer, Data Scientist (actually Analytics it seems), Research Scientist, Research Engineer (its like SWE but applied research)
ML engineer: no reinventing, use models that already exist, its a lot of data engineering!
Data Scientist: not much ML, a lot of SQL, a lot of visualization, making charts 
all new grads at Fb come at level IC3 (aka L3) even if you have a masters (you probably get paid 10% more), then it takes 1 year to get L4

why bloomberg:
- my interests lie in technology (software etc), finance (investing, private banking etc), data (im specialized in data science, they won Data Provider of the Year 2022) hence why im doing MSc CS + Minor in Fin. Eng.. It is the perfect bridge that ties up my main interests and hence I am very excited about the prospect of interviewing with bloomberg -> can gain deep understanding of financial industry while working on impactful projects
- I love their commitment to c++ open source, even went to the extent of writing their own book on the libraries they use. shows that they care about their work environment and always strive for the best
- most important of all; bloomberg philantropies: I strongly believe that future breakthroughs are engineered by today's leaders. from my understanding, bloomberg has been actively improving lives around the world by consulting and improving in five main sectors. Such pioneering is worthy of respect, especially in today's time where environmental considerations are becoming more prevalent

tell me about....:
- proximeety: yanis was super good but used to working alone (no communication, takes on most of the load), others not as much (no mobile dev experience, language barrier etc). I was somewhere in the middle, and ended up bridging between these 2 sides and encourage a harmonious working environment where everyone can benefit (conflict resolution skills gained from MUN experience etc)
- big mistake; first time taking a lead role, wanted to do a really good job, ended up being embarassingly off in my estimate (didn't take into account wiggle room, i was positive and everyone was optimistic in their responses and so on). ended up extending deadline and cutting some features. ended up correcting this for next milestone, added some padding, and we finished ahead of schedule
- underperforming teammate: had a teammate that seemed to be trying their best, but wasn't submitting any code. had a talk with him, tried to pinpoint the problem. turns out he had to continue working on someone else's part, didn't understand how it worked, and was too embarassed to ask for help. helped him out, also guided him to start on a fresh part of the project. he was able to get through the project and showed himself to be generally smart and capable, just had to deal with some gaps in his knowledge

John B.
write me a small essay saying why using the UNet architecture is a great idea for segmentation tasks

The UNet architecture is a popular choice for image segmentation tasks because it is able to effectively combine the high resolution information from earlier layers with the contextual information from deeper layers. This is achieved through the use of skip connections, which allow the model to pass information from earlier layers directly to deeper layers, allowing the model to make more precise segmentation decisions.

Another advantage of the UNet architecture is its ability to handle large amounts of data. The use of encoder-decoder architecture allows the model to efficiently process and compress the input data, making it well-suited for tasks involving large images or volumes.

def process_image(image):
    # Split the image into four 400x400 images
    image1 = image[:400, :400]
    image2 = image[:400, 208:]
    image3 = image[208:, :400]
    image4 = image[208:, 208:]

    # Process the images using a function
    result1 = process_function(image1)
    result2 = process_function(image2)
    result3 = process_function(image3)
    result4 = process_function(image4)

    # Combine the results back into a single 608x608 image
    result = np.zeros((608, 608))
    result[:400, :400] = result1
    result[:400, 208:] = result2
    result[208:, :400] = result3
    result[208:, 208:] = result4

    # Average the common pixels
    result[400:, :208] = (result1[400:, -208:] + result2[400:, :208]) / 2
    result[400:, 208:] = (result2[400:, 208:] + result4[400:, :208]) / 2
    result[:208, 400:] = (result1[-208:, 400:] + result3[:208, 400:]) / 2
    result[208:, 400:] = (result3[208:, 400:] + result4[:208, 400:]) / 2

    return result

This function works in the same way as the previous version, but it also averages the common pixels when recombining the four 400x400 split images. The common pixels are those that are shared between the four images, and are located at the edges of the images. By averaging these pixels, we can smooth out any discontinuities that might have been introduced during the processing.

Dear Professor [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you about the [assignment name] that is due [due date]. As you may know, our group was originally composed of three members, but one member dropped out and the second member has been facing some personal challenges recently. His wife had a miscarriage and his mother was diagnosed with cancer, which have made it difficult for him to work on the assignment. Additionally, my own grandmother passed away recently, which has also been a source of distraction and stress for me.

I understand that the expectations for this assignment remain the same, and I want to assure you that I am committed to meeting them to the best of my ability. However, given the circumstances, I was hoping that you might be able to provide some leniency in the grading given the impact these personal challenges may have had on the quality of the assignment. While I still want my work to be judged up to the standards of the course, I recognize that I may not have been able to achieve the level of work that I normally would have under different circumstances.

I was wondering if there is any flexibility in the due date or if there are any other options that might be available to help us complete the assignment. I would be grateful for any guidance or suggestions you might have.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

# The acting industry through the ages: Comparing successful actor profiles from different generations

## Data Story

Please visit our website [here!](https://arvind6599.github.io/datastory/)

## Abstract

All actors and movie directors have their own motivation to work hard and achieve success. Gaining valuable insight into factors that contribute to a movie's success and an actor's career skyrocketing can thus aid people in the industry to make casting decisions.
We will explore the relationship between actor/actress experience and movie success/popularity with goals of forming a descriptive analysis of actor-feature data to summarize and compare successful actor profiles from different generations. We will also be looking at potential trends through time and extract meaningful information.

## Tackled research question

- What are the main factors that guide the audience towards making a binary decision regarding movies?
  - We look at the movie genre
  - And the leading actors that make up the cast

## Datasets
We use the IMDB movie and actor datasets which can be found [here](https://datasets.imdbws.com/). Make sure to create and place them in your `data/` folder if you wish to rerun the code. We also supplement it with some additional data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data?resource=download).


## Methodology

### Step 1

- Filter for leading actors and add column for gender

We filter for leading actors based on imdb's principals data which contains for each movie the most important people (i. e. actors, actress, directors etc.). The importance is given by imdb and stored in the 'ordering' column



- Add column for age of actor during start of movie

- Add column for imdb ratings

- Add column for number of movies an actor has been in before start of respective movie


- Filter out movies from unwanted movie genres = ["Animation", "Biography", "Documentary","Short"]
    - Animation - Only voice actors meanning that casting is heavily dictated by voice and language
    - Biography, Documentary - Heavily dependent on the subject
    - Short - We aim to study larger scale movies
- Study the genre density of the movie dataset
- Calculate the experience of actors per genre at the time of each movie release

### Step 2
- Feature engineering

- Genre pattern evaluation.

- Correlation matrix of the background of actors (i.e., experience in each genre) to the genre of the movie he was filming.



### Step 3: Analysis of the actor's features over time



A confounder to consider: Actor experience and audience preference

- The preferences of moviegoers can change over time. What may have been popular in one era may not be as popular in another. Itâ€™s important to consider how audience preferences may have changed over the different time periods we are analyzing. So let's see what we can find. We will divide our data into subgroups that depend on time periods (think baby boomer era vs gen Z era for example) to reduce the impact of the previously considered confounders; movies in the same time-period are much more likely to be made using similar technology and during comparable economic conditions. We can see how audience preference shifts through time by seeing how the top movies genres vary through time and which genres did actors gain most experience in

      Greatest Generation (born circa 1901 to 1924)
      Silent Generation (circa 1925 to 1945)
      Baby Boomers (circa 1946 to 1964)
      Generation X (circa 1965 to 1985)
      Millennial Generation (circa 1985 to 1996)
      Gen Z (post-Millennial) (circa 1997 to 2012)


- Visualise actor feature change over generations for each genre

    Since weighting the average with any success metrics does not really matter, we are not considering a movie success metric for the following visuals. This means that we cannot say that those are the profiles of successfull actors.

- Find average actor movie experience over the years

- Do more experienced actors/actresses tend to star in certain genres more frequently?

- We generate the per genre movie experience distribution of the top 1000 actors per generation in 3 different cases:
    - Only look at male actors
    - Only look at female actors
    - Combine both




### Step 4: Do Popular Actors stick to their best genres in the recent scenario?

From here one we only look at the latest generation (which concerns us)

- calculate the diversity in an Actor's genre background from past movies using entropy
  - Using shannons entropy H which returns 0 if an actor has only been part of 1 genre, and highest value = 2.32 (log_2(5)) for a uniform distriubiton. [ Since we are using 5 major genres to construct the major genre vector]

- Use the number of votes to decide the IMDB rating of their past movies as a metric of popularity
