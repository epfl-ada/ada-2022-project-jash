# Analysing and predicitng movie characters (= trope)
## Abstract: A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?
- Project Goals
    1. interactive tool for predicting movie character (= trope) based on features of actor
    2. data story in connection with prediciton of trope: Analysing the usage of tropes in movies overt-time and each trope's influence on the successfulness of a movie (measured in revenue of movie)

## Research Questions: A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
1. 
2. Which features of an actor (age, nationality, height etc.) influence the assignment to a trope class? By how much?

## Proposed additional datasets (if any): List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.
1. wikidata for getting the missing heights of some actors as well as nationality (= ethnicity)
2. 

## Methods
1. Potential methods to build movie character classifier: linear regression, k-nearest neighbor, decision tree etc.
2.r

## Proposed timeline
- parallel work: one part of the team works on the data story, the other on the interactvie ML classifier

## Organization within the team: A list of internal milestones up until project Milestone P3.

## Questions for TAs (optional): Add here any questions you have for us related to the proposed project.
