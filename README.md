## Abstract

All actors and movie directors have their own motivation to work hard and achieve success. Gaining valuable insight into factors that contribute to a movie's success and an actor's career skyrocketing can thus aid people in the industry to make casting decisions.
We will explore the relationship between actor/actress experience and movie success/popularity with goals of forming a descriptive analysis of actor-feature data to summarize and compare successful actor profiles from different generations. We will also be looking at potential trends through time and extract meaningful information.

## Tackled research question

- What are the main factors that guide the audience towards making a binary decision regarding movies?
  - We look at the movie genre
  - And the leading actors that make up the cast
